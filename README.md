# Overview
This new analysis helps support the other charts and data we presented by focusing more on the type of city and what revenue each type brings in via fares so V.Isualize can make informed decisions going forward. Our task was to dive into the different city types and use the data to tell the story of how revenue differs from one to the other. The data shows a large discrepancy in drivers - which correlates to fare discrepancies overall. The rural areas have fewer drivers and longer trips than the other two, and this leads to less revenue overall. V. Isualize will need to consider this when making decisions about the buisness plan going forward.

The images above show the large discrepancy between Rural city fares and the other two categories. Rural cities not only have lower drivers, but the average fare week over week is lower as a result. The difficult part about this dataset is that it doesn't show the demand for rides in rural areas vs the available drivers. There could be limiting factors not considered in this excersise that will lead to a resolution for V. Isualize
#Summary
Based on the results of this assignment, I can suggest three things to hopefully address the issues presented: 
- Driver incentives for rural areas. There aren't as many resources available in rural areas that allow people to become drivers. Things like providing a vehicle or providing bonuses for new drivers could increase rides overall because of more drivers available.
- Getting discounts or subsities that would help cover the larger trip costs for rural areas could help incentivize consumers to get rides more often. Also, allowing riders to carpool rides might offset costs. 
- Gathering more data. The key piece of information that would help make business decisions would be demand. How much demand is there in rural areas for PyBer? Getting to the root of that question would open up more potential strategies for growth. If there is no demand, how can we generate it? If there is demand, how can we accomodate it? Ultimately, I think more analysis is needed here.
